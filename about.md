title: "About this blog"
---

First, I want to express my deepest gratitude to James Williamson, a great enthusiast of Jekyll and the guy who designed this website back in 2015. For this blog, he wrote and published ten posts on Jekyll which I chose to keep here untouched. You can visit his website, which is still online, at [SimplePrimate](http://simpleprimate.com/ "SimplePrimate"). James is no more with us, so Rest In Peace, James, you are my hero.

I'd been looking for a design of a text blog where I could've posted articles about my successes and failures in studying JavaSript, CSS, SASS, etc. Then I found James's blog, and I thought its design suited me perfectly.

My original intention was to use my notes here in the blog as a means to refresh my memory now and then if any detail in the practice of web development that I used to know slips my mind. But who knows, perhaps it could be of use for someone else.

### About the Author

I'm an English teacher and translator turned webdev student in my old age of 63. I'm going to write posts for this blog under the nick Studiosus. I'm interested in learning as much JavaScript, Jekyll, PHP and Ruby as I only can. I'm still eager to teach English non-native speakers of it, though.
